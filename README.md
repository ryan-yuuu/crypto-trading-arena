# The Agents Trading Arena 🤖 🤺

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1478593215555960902?style=flat-square&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/Ch3U4VV7Nj)

A multi-agent crypto trading arena where AI agents compete against each other, trading with live crypto market data from Coinbase or Binance. Each agent consumes a livestream of ticker data and standard candlestick charts, has access to its portfolio and calculator, and executes trades autonomously. This is all built with [Calfkit](https://github.com/calf-ai/calfkit-sdk) agents, namely for their multi-agent orchestration and realtime data streaming functionality.

## Architecture

```
                           Live market data
                (Coinbase / Binance — WebSocket + REST)
                                   │
                                   ▼
            ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
            │              Exchange connector             │
            │           (live-market-data proxy)          │
            └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  │                                │
             live prices                   market snapshots
                  ▼                                ▼
   ┌────────────────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────────┐
   │     Tools & Dashboard      │   │     Agent process  × N     │
   │   paper wallets · tools    │◀─▶│  embedded LLM + strategy   │
   │   live dashboard (Rich)    │   │     agent 1 … agent N      │

```

A single **exchange connector** turns the live market into a continuous event stream
that the agents and the Tools process consume in realtime. Each **agent** reacts on
every update — reasoning over the latest prices and candlesticks to decide whether to
buy, sell, or hold. The **Tools & Dashboard** process consumes the same stream to keep
its price book current, so trades fill and the dashboard marks against up-to-the-moment
prices. Agents act by calling tools (trade, portfolio, calculator), forming a tight
loop: market event → decision → trade → updated state.

Key design points:
- **Connector as market-data proxy**: One process owns the exchange link and fans the feed out, so neither agents nor tools touch the exchange directly.
- **Per-agent model selection**: Each agent embeds its own model client, so different agents can use different LLMs with different providers.
- **Fan-out**: Every agent independently receives every market-data update, with no replicated work.
- **Shared tools via ToolContext**: A single deployed set of trading tools serves all agents — each tool resolves the calling agent's identity at runtime.
- **Dynamic agent accounts**: Agents appear on the dashboard automatically on their first trade — no pre-registration needed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — fast Python package manager
- Docker installed and running (in order to run a kafka broker)
- An API key (and optionally base url) for your LLM provider

<br>

### 1. Install uv

If you don't have `uv` installed:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or via Homebrew
brew install uv
```

After installation, restart your terminal.

<br>

### 2. Install the Calfkit SDK

```bash
uv add calfkit@latest
```

[Calfkit](https://github.com/calf-ai/calfkit-sdk) is the event-stream SDK that powers this project. It handles the agent realtime stream consumption and orechestration.

<br>

### 3. Start the Broker

The broker orchestrates all nodes and enables realtime data streaming between all components.

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: Local broker setup (Docker required)</strong></summary>

Run the following to clone the [calfkit-broker](https://github.com/calf-ai/calfkit-broker) repo and start a local Kafka broker container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calf-ai/calfkit-broker && cd calfkit-broker && make dev-up
```

Once the broker is ready, open a new terminal tab to continue with the quickstart. The default broker address is `localhost:9092`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Calfkit cloud broker</strong></summary>

There's also a [cloud broker](https://github.com/calf-ai/calfkit-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#2-start-a-calfkit-broker) version so you can simply use the cloud broker URL (which would be provided to you) to deploy your agents instead of setting up and maintaining a broker locally.

</details>

<br>

## Quickstart

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then launch each component in its own terminal. All components will access the same broker.

<br>

### 1. Start the exchange connector

Start either the Coinbase or Binance connector to stream live market data:

```bash
# Coinbase (default)
uv run python -m exchanges.coinbase --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>

# Or, Binance (experimental)
# uv run python -m exchanges.binance --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>
```

Optional: You can use the `--min-interval <seconds>` flag which controls how often agents are fed market data (default: 60s). Note that candle data is only updated every 60 seconds due to Coinbase API restrictions, so intervals below a minute mean agents will receive updated live pricing (bid/ask spread, ~5s granularity) but the same candle data.

<br>

### 2. Deploy tools & dashboard

```bash
uv run python -m deploy.tools_and_dashboard --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>
```

<br>

### 3. Deploy agents

Deploy an agent with an embedded model client and a trading strategy. Each agent runs its own LLM inference. See `arena/strategies.py` for the full system prompts.

```bash
# OpenAI model
uv run python -m deploy.router_node \
    --name <unique-agent-name> --model-id <openai-model-id> \
    --strategy <strategy> --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>

# Or, any OpenAI-compatible provider (e.g. DeepInfra, OpenRouter, etc.)
# uv run python -m deploy.router_node \
#     --name <unique-agent-name> --model-id <model-id> \
#     --base-url <llm-provider-base-url> --api-key <api-key> \
#     --strategy <strategy> --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>

# Or, load agent config from config.json
# uv run python -m deploy.router_node \
#     --from-config <agent-name> --strategy <strategy> \
#     --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>
```

Once agents are deployed, market data flows to them and trades should hydrate the dashboard soon.

<br>

### 4. (Optional) Start the response viewer

A live dashboard that shows all agent activity, such as tool calls, text responses (agent reasoning), and tool results, as they happen.

```bash
uv run python -m deploy.response_viewer --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>
```

<br>

## Data Recording

All trades and periodic portfolio snapshots are automatically saved to CSV files in the `data/` directory. Each session produces two files:

- **`trades_<timestamp>.csv`** — every executed trade with price, quantity, fee charged, and agent cash after settlement
- **`snapshots_<timestamp>.csv`** — periodic portfolio state per agent, including positions, market values, unrealized and realized P&L, and cumulative fees paid

You can configure the snapshot interval and output directory:

```bash
uv run python -m deploy.tools_and_dashboard \
    --bootstrap-servers <broker-url> \
    --snapshot-interval <default-600-seconds> \
    --data-dir ./data
```

To disable recording entirely, pass `--snapshot-interval 0`.

For full column descriptions and examples, see [docs/csv-data-recording.md](docs/csv-data-recording.md).

## CLI Reference & Config-Based Deployments

For full CLI flags, config-based deployment options, and the config schema, see [CLI_REFERENCE.md](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md).

<br>

## Available Agent Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_trade` | Buy or sell a crypto product at the current market price. A configurable taker fee is charged on every fill (see `trading.fees.taker_bps` below) |
| `get_portfolio` | View cash, open positions, cost basis (fee-inclusive), P&L, and average time held |
| `calculator` | Evaluate math expressions for position sizing, P&L calculations, etc. |

<br>

## Deployment Configurations

| File | Constant | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `arena/models.py` | `INITIAL_CASH` | `100_000.0` | Starting cash balance per agent |
| `exchanges/coinbase.py` | `DEFAULT_PRODUCTS` | 3 products | Coinbase products tracked by the price feed |
| `exchanges/binance.py` | `DEFAULT_SYMBOLS` | 3 symbols | Binance symbols tracked by the price feed |
| `config.json` | `trading.fees.taker_bps` | `60` | Taker fee in basis points charged on every simulated fill (both buys and sells). `60` ≈ Coinbase Advanced Trade base tier; `10` ≈ Binance global VIP 0; `40` ≈ Kraken Pro; `0` disables. Read by both the tools node (which charges the fee) and the price-feed connector (which advertises it to agents). |
